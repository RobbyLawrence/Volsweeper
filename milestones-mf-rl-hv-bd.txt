1. this will be a project that creates the game minesweeper and a bot that is written with an algorithm that can complete a game of minesweeper. 
 
 - board needs to be built

 - the goals for the board are as follows: we'd like for the board to be solvable without any guessing; that is, we should be able to deterministically
 solve the minesweeper game following a set of patterns and rules. The easiest way to do this is to build a bot that can solve Minesweeper by applying a
 set of patterns. So these two goals are deeply intertwined. (current progress: I (robby) have implemented a random board, but haven't implemented any rules
 that eliminate the possibilites of 9's and 8's).

 - game logic
 - bot 
 - bot logic

	the bot logic will be based off of being given patterns that it will be able to identify very quickly and solve the minesweeper
	puzzle on its own in very little time.

	We will be implementing the patterns shown in the minesweeper online handbook posted here. https://minesweeper.online/help/patterns.
