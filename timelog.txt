Date: March 26
Meeting Details: Started project with initial goals, different assignments were given to members, Robby would start 
with the board generation, Brett and Hien on the bot, and Matthew on the GUI.
Members there: Brett, Robby, Matthew, Hien

Date: April 13
Meeting Details: Was the check in before our first progress report was due. Discussed mainly how we were using Cmake to compile 
our code, instead of a makefile. Everyone worked on their respective parts of the assignment and shared progress made so far.
Members there: Brett, Robby, Matthew, Hien

Date: April 15
Meeting Details: In class work day, the main highlight was Matthew showing us his progress on the GUI where 
he determined that he was using Python’s Pygame.
Members there: Brett, Robby, Matthew, Hien

Date: April 21
Meeting Details: Check in before progress report number two. The main highlight of this session was Robby explaining the 
challenges of the board generation and showing us how there has been extensive research done in order to try to 
solve the problem of creating a 100 percent solvable minesweeper board.
Members there: Brett, Robby, Matthew, Hien

Date: April 26
Meeting Details: Group meeting to show progress, Robby had decided on the method he was going to choose to make the 
board, and Brett and Hien displayed their progress on the bot so far.
